    description: "iOS 26 Update is a fictional interface built into the iOS 26 update, designed to turn waiting time into a quiet and introspective moment. It appears only during the update process.\nThe experience is optional: users can choose to try it or skip straight to the classic update screen, discovering a small and unexpected space each time the system updates.\n\nWith Apple Intelligence, users can generate a personal message by answering a short custom questionnaire. The text is unique and editable, and they can also read again the message they wrote during the previous update.\n\nAt the same time, the interface shows the update progress at the bottom of the screen. It stays simple, battery friendly and unobtrusive, giving a human touch to a moment that is usually seen as forced or purely functional."

    description: "iOS 26 Update est une interface fictive intégrée à la mise à jour iOS 26, conçue pour transformer l'attente en un moment introspectif et poétique, accessible uniquement lors des mises à jour. L'expérience est facultative : l'utilisateur peut choisir d'y participer ou de passer directement à l'écran classique, découvrant ainsi un espace inattendu à chaque mise à jour.\n\nGrâce à Apple Intelligence, l'utilisateur peut générer un texte en répondant à un questionnaire personnalisé. Le texte généré est unique et modifiable. L'utilisateur peut aussi relire son message laissé durant la précédente mise à jour. En parallèle, l'interface affiche la progression de la mise à jour en bas, sobre et optimisée pour la batterie, humanisant un instant souvent perçu comme contraint."
